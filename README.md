# Ironhack Data Analytics Module 2 Project

Diamonds dataset analysis to see how different parameters affect to price. This analysis will later be used to build a model that estimates price.

### :computer: **Job done**
Previous analysis on python and data processing. Dashboard building in Tableau to show main conclussions.

### :boom: **Main Conclussions**
I've made two main analysis:
- For numerical variables: at first, I will just consider for the model carat. Price has also big correlation with x, y and z but those also are correlated with carat.

- For categorical variables: I didn't get a clear conclussion analysing Cut, Color and Clarity sepparated. I created groups for each parameter of Cut, Color and Clarity and represented it's relationship between carat and price. I saw there is a linear relationship where the line's slope is almost constant and the only thing that variates is the function's displacement.

Next steps: estimate the line's formula for each subgroup created so the price can be estimated very accurately.

### :wrench: **Technology Stack and Configuration**
Used Python, libraries needed: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn. Also used Tableau.
